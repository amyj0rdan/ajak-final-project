Our personal goals were closely aligned, allowing us to focus on some common themes.

*Agile*:
It was important to us all to work in an agile manner, with Kim wanting an extra focus
to share her previous experience.

*Machine Learning*:
Since we had all voted to be in the AI group, we decided to go forward with a project idea that
would incorporate machine learning.

*New Language*:
We all wanted to learn and apply a new language, due to curiosity and feeling comfortable with
languages learned previously. This ambition combined with machine learning naturally lead us to using Python.

## Work plan

- Stand up: 9:30am
- Retro: 5:30pm
- Pairing: rotate daily
- Mobbing: group up to defeat blockers, discuss new ideas etc
- Pull Requests: all PRs to be reviewed by the other pair before merge
- Make time for individual learning: 1 hour every **few** days
- Github Wiki

## MVP

Our program should be able to return the correct shape name when given test data.
We aim for an accuracy rate of at least (70?)%.
